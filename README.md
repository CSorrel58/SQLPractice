# SQLPractice
Saved documents showing my SQL queries from public data repostories
This repository contains SQL queries I have written in PGAdmin4 and exported. The information I used to create the databases is contained in the repository as well, as a zip file.

BaseballAwards - this was a project from code academy that taught me how to install psql and create a database. I then wrote some queries based on their recommendations and added some of my own ( my own are at the bottom and indicated by a comment)
